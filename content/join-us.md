Data Science is a spectrum and we usually find 3 types of professionals: Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Business Analyst. Below, we've listed caracteristics that are common amongst each.

- Comfortable working with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure;
- A grounded understanding of system architectures, especially those targeted at data intensive applications;
- Working knowledge of computer networks and distributed systems;
- Security minded, and understands basic concepts of threat modeling and cryptography;
- Knows how to exit VIM; 

### Data Scientist

## <b>How to apply?</b>

We believe that a selection processes should be fair and open to the widest audience possible. To achieve this, we've created a public challenge that is available at our GitHub page. We try as much as possible to hire based on candidate **potential** and not experience. To apply, generate a **private** repository from [our template](https://github.com/3778/ml-challenge) and start solving the challenge. When you think it looks good enough, invite FULANO to be a contributor on GitHub. The diagram below illustrates the rest.
